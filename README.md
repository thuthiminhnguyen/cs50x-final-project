#### Description:
In the busy life, people will not have much time to control these things, so the page may comfort user after hard working days because the web was designed with a simple theme but with useful tools. People can use this web application to manage there balance and add the recipes that they love. Moreover, the user can see other users so that they can learn from that. My inspiration comes from my friend when she has to write down her expenses every single day. And one more thing is that I have a bad memory, I cannot remember the recipe that my mom teach me, when I was a kid, I had a notebook for that, but now I do not use it anymore so I want to create a website  that I can use to store recipes. Furthermore, since we can see others recipes, it will be a good source for me to learn from other people. This web app also help users save their personal information in case they may forget. Specifically, your phone number, your address, even your photo and etc.

**Register and Login**
In other to usen this web application, user must login, if you do not have an account yet, you can register.
- The register: you need to provide your name account and the password, then you have to confirm the password again.
- The login includes your account's name and your password that you generated.

**The main page**
After login you will see a main page with multiple photos that

**Balance**
This is one of the main functions of the web app.
You will see the amount of your balance and all of your expenditures for each day.
- Income:
You can input you cash, the amount of debit account and all kinds of income with the edit button below the amount of money. Note that: this is the amount of CHANGE, you no need to calculate your amount of money again, let's the computer do that.

- Outcome:
You can add your expenditure for each day. For example you spend $1 for lunch on 10th May, when you enter your expenditure, it will be saved automatically the date for you, and on the left hand side of date is the name of what you has spent and the right hand side is the amount of money. When you want to edit the amount of money you spend on your item, you can go to add a new expenditure with the same name for name and change the amount of money by add or substract in that date.

**Cook**
This is the second important function in Your daily life. For students, especially who live far from home, they may want to have a tool to save their traditional recipes.
User can add or delete the recipe that they were created. There is a form for them to add the new recipe.
> This form includes the name of dish, the description, inngredients, preparation time , cook time, image for illustration and directions.

After adding the new recipe, users will that recipes on the same page, with colorful photos and all of directions for their dishes.

Similarly, if users want to delete a recipe, they will click to the button delete on the top, and then it will appear a form. After that, users have to type the EXACT name of the recipe they want to delete, if the name of the recipe is not in the list of their recipes, the web will provide an apology, and then users have to type again until that dish exists. Similar to add new recipe, after deleting the user will see the cook page again, but there is no recipe that they have deleted.
